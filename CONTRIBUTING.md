# Contributing to xConnect Code Samples

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the code, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before creating a PR.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. 

## Pull Requests

PRs to our repo are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. 

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a list clearly outlining what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (defined in DotSettings files) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
